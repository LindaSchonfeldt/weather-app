# 🌦️ Project Weather App

Re-factored code from a project where we built a weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an external API. Users can search for any city and instantly get information about the current temperature, a weather description, and a matching icon. The app also displays a 4-day forecast with upcoming weather conditions.

The project is mainly developed using **TypeScript**, with some supporting **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
