# 🌦️ Project Weather App

We built a weather application that fetches real-time weather data from an external API. Users can search for any city and instantly get information about the current temperature, a weather description, and a matching icon. The app also displays a 4-day forecast with upcoming weather conditions.

The project is mainly developed using **TypeScript**, with some supporting **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

This was a group project where we used both **mob programming** and worked in smaller breakout groups to collaborate effectively. Along the way, we faced several challenges – from API issues to layout bugs – but we solved them together. It’s been a learning experience filled with hard work, teamwork, and a lot of fun.

We're proud of the result, but even more proud of how we worked together as a team.
